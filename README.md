Hello and Welcome to the Game Development Club's Semester long project!

Throughout the semester we will be going through the process of designing and creating this game as a team!
The project is made using Godot 4.5 so that it is easy for anyone to come and download the engine and game and start working.

All tasks that need to be created or updated are to be posted on the Jira at this link: https://trello.com/b/YrhRHMQG/arsenal
Please only take one task per person and respect the person that has claimed a task as they might just be learning.

All discussion about the project will be posted on the discord channel and/or discussed at the various meetings!
No experience is required for this project however any AI generated scripts/code/assets are strictly prohibited!

Have fun and happy coding!
-Logan!

Arsenal is a top down, rougelike, dating simulator where you try to climb to the top of an apartment building to stop the evil 
bureaucrats who are outlawing human gun marriage.
As you climb you develop a closer relationship with your "Gun". Stop the goons from using these guns as tools and liberate them.
